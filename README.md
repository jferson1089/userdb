## User Database

#### Create a Python/Django back end database that can be filled up with Random User Applicants from RandomUser.me API.

- Randomly generate users from RandomUser.me and use that info to create users in this database
- Make these random users searchable
- Sign Up Area
- Display the Users in our database in different selectable orders
- RandomUser.me has a large selection of random data. Would like to be able to put as much of that data as possible into our database such as real world applications would have similar data.
- Front end interface to allow users to be manaully entered.
